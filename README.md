# Space Invaders Game 🎮

This is a simple 2D **Space Invaders** game developed using **C++** as part of my **Programming Fundamentals** project at **FAST National University**. The game uses a custom graphics header file to render basic shapes (lines, circles, ellipses) and capture keyboard input.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- C++
- Custom graphics header file (for basic shapes and key detection)
- Procedural programming

## 🚀 Features
- Player-controlled spaceship (move left/right)
- Enemy alien movement in grid formation
- Bullet firing and collision detection
- Game over condition
- Simple scoring system

## 🕹️ Controls
- **Left Arrow**: Move left
- **Right Arrow**: Move right
- **Spacebar**: Fire bullet

## 📚 Project Context
This game was created as a semester project for the **Programming Fundamentals** course at **FAST-NU**. The goal was to apply basic C++ concepts such as conditionals, loops, arrays, and functions in a creative way using console graphics.

## 📦 How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open the `.cpp` file in your IDE (e.g., Dev C++, Code::Blocks)
3. Ensure the graphics header file is linked properly
4. Compile and run
